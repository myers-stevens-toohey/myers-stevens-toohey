<h1>Long Term Care</h1>

<h4>How do active and retired members of CSFA benefit from the CSFEWBC sponsored Long Term Care Plans?</h4>

<p>For one, security, CSFEWBC has contracted with the top LTC insurance companies in the country. All CSFA insurance carriers quoted are top rated and fully regulated by the California Department of Insurance. </p>

<h4>What is Long Term Care Insurance, and do I need it?</h4> 

<p>The purpose of Long Term Care insurance is to protect you and your families assets against the ever increasing costs associated with the care of a family member due to a serious long term illness or disability. That care can range from home health care and adult day care to nursing home or community based care. It also includes respite care (which gives family members a break from caring for a disabled family member at home). It is the care provided by another party for the benefit of a family member who is unable to care for themselves. Care is not limited to the elderly; in fact 40% of all Long Term Care recipients are of working age under 65. This is care that is not covered by health insurance, Medicare or Medicare Supplements.</p> 

<h4>What are the costs of Long Term Care?</h4> 

<p>The national average cost is $120/day for a nursing home stay. In some states the average costs are $200 to $300 per day. This translates to paying more than $50,000 for a one year stay. For most people, paying these expenses out -of-pocket for an extended period of time can mean financial devastation. This is not coverage you wait until you are close to retiring to apply, by that time the premiums associated with insuring an individual of your age might be cost prohibitive. You want to plan ahead and enroll in an insured LTC program while your still relatively young so that you can apply for the coverage to protect you in the future at an affordable rate.</p> 

<h4>How do I know what program is right for me?</h4> 

<p>Since Long Term Care is not a “one size fits all” insurance, it is important to take advantage of the knowledgeable LTC agents to explain what is available and what is best for you and your future. CSFA is committed to offering you only the best and most reputable LTC products.</p>
