<h1>Disability Coverage</h1>

<h3><em>Long Term Disability (LTD) Details</em></h3>

<p><em>One of the most important insurance coverages a firefighter can have -- Why, because it protects your ability to financially provide for yourself and your family</em></p>

<p>Disability is more common than you think. Did you know...</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Two-thirds of American families live paycheck to paycheck</strong> <cite>(Parade Magazine, Is the American Dream Still Possible?, April 23, 2006).</cite></li>

  <li><strong>Disability causes nearly 50% of all mortgage foreclosures, 2% are caused by death.</strong> <cite>(Health Affairs, The Policy Journal of Health Sphere, February 2, 2005).</cite></li>

  <li><strong>By the nature of firefighter's work, they are more likely to become disabled than most professions.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, you have a one in five chance of becoming disabled. According to the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI), a person age 35 is six times more likely to become disabled than die before he or she reaches age 65. These statistics are based on the general populace. You, as a firefighter have a much higher likelihood of becoming disabled because of both the physical and emotional demands of your career. Simply put, this is your "Paycheck" Insurance coverage on and off the job.</p>

<p>Becoming disabled can have devastating financial implications for you and your family by stripping you of your ability to make a living. While some members may get by without working for a few months by relying upon their sick leave and savings, few can afford to go without a paycheck for an extended period of time. At some point you will need to ask yourself, "How am I going to take care of my family?". The answer is the Long Term Disability Program through CSFEWBC.</p>

<p><strong>Why are the CSFEWBC plans the best option for CSFA members? </strong></p>

<p>In 1992, CSFEWBC created the Partially Self-Funded Long Term Disability Plan to provide the members with a more affordable disability plan without sacrificing the rich benefit schedule or the long term financial security provided through a multi-billion dollar insurance company, Standard Insurance Company. Under this program, CSFEWBC self-funds the benefits payable during the first 5 years of a disability and after age 65. Standard Insurance Company fully insures the benefits after the initial 5 years of disability until age 65. Through this arrangement you receive the cost saving associated with self-funded plans, lower rates, with all the long term benefit guarantees provided by an insurance carrier. Having an insurance company backing the plan long term is vital to providing you and your family with the peace of mind knowing disability payments will continue to be paid now and in the future.</P>

<p><strong>CSFEWBC offers a Group LTD and an Individual LTD Plan </strong></p>
