<h1>Life</h1>

<h4>Do I need life insurance?</h4> 

<p>To put it simply, we invest for the known and insure for the unknown. Life insurance protects those who depend on you in the event you die prematurely. Life insurance can provide your dependents with an o­ngoing income to replace yours, so they can at least cover the basic needs of daily living. If you are the primary breadwinner for your family, you are likely to need a substantial amount of life insurance coverage. After basic food and housing concerns are satisfied, life insurance needs to be in line in terms of priority.</p> 

<p>CSFEWBC offers both the Group Life "Participating Unit" Plan as well as the Individual Life "Voluntary" Plan.</p>

        <h5>Features of 10-Year Group Level Term Plan</h5>
        <p>This Supplemental Group Term Life plan provides eligible members with group term life insurance protection at levels beyond what is provided to you through your employer's participating unit coverage. With the CSFA-sponsored 10-year Level Group Term Life Insurance Plan, your initial premium may stay level, and not change, for up to 10 years. However, the insurance company does reserve the right to change the premium rates, but may o¬nly do so for all insureds covered under the group policy and with 60 days notice.</p>
        
        <p>As a member of CSFA age 65 and under, you are eligible to apply for coverage with a 10-year level premium in amounts ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000, in increments of $50,000. Your spouse (under age 60) may apply for coverage in this same plan, in an amount not to exceed 50% of your coverage amount.</p>

        <h5>You can keep this level term protection for 10 years.</h5>
        <p>At the end of the 10 year level term period, evidence of insurability is required to enter another level term period (subject to the maximum age to begin a level term period). If evidence of insurability is not provided or not approved by ReliaStar Life, rates will be based on the five-year age brackets for the insured's current age.</p>
