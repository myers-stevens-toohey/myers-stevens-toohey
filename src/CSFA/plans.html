<h1>Plans we offer</h1>

<h4>Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment</h4>

<p>Considering the high risks associated with working as a firefighter, AD&amp;D insurance coverage can provide an inexpensive level of protection for you and your family against the financial impact of a fatal accident. AD&amp;D insurance coverage is an excellent way to supplement your existing life insurance against the unexpected.</p>

<h4>Disability Coverage</h4>

<p>Simply put, this program protects your paycheck 24/7 in the event you're disabled and can't work. While your paycheck may be gone, your bills and your family's living expenses will continue. The CSFEWBC Long Term Disability program will enable you to continue to meet those financial obligations.</p>

<h4>Life</h4>

<p>There are two certainties in life; death and taxes. The primary purpose of life insurance is to provide a continued source of income, in case of your death, for your spouse, children, dependents, or other beneficiaries.</p>

<h4>Long Term Care</h4>

<p>Members are living a lot longer. That's the good news. But increased longevity has created a new financial dilemma: how to prepare for the high cost of old age. Some of us will need care for chronic ailments, but many more will need assistance with simple activities of daily living. The costs associated with this care can be financially devastating to you and your family if you're not prepared.</p>

<h4>Volunteer Firefighters - Accident and Health Coverage</h4>

<p>Volunteers risk their lives and face serious injury every time they answer a call. California Workers' Compensation will provide benefits, however it may not cover all the costs associated with expenses and lost wages. That's where our Accident &amp; Health coverage can make a real difference. </p>
