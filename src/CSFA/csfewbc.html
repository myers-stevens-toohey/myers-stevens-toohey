<h1>California State Firefighters Employee Welfare Benefits</h1>
<h3>"The Benefits Division of CSFA"</h3>

<h4>CSFEWBC History</h4> 
<p>In 1967, Chet Moller (CSFA's General Manager) and CSFA Board of Directors became interested in providing additional insurance benefits for the membership. At the time, life insurance and accidental death benefits were difficult for firefighters to obtain on their own. CSFA Executive Board selected Myers-Stevens as their broker to assist them in developing an insurance program for the membership. This same year the Insurance Committee for CSFA was formed.</p>

<p>In 1982, due to new ERISA law changes, the CSFA insurance committee developed a Trust providing more protection of funding for the membership. In 1991, the Trust incorporated to become the California State Firefighters' Employee Welfare Benefits Corporation (CSFEWBC), a separate non-profit corporation from CSFA.</p>

<h4>The Board</h4>

<p>CSFEWBC board consists of a five (5) Board of Trustees, all firefighters (active and retired). The board combines for over 125 years of experience in the firefighter industry, The CSFEWBC board meets on a regular basis to review existing plans and explore new insurance benefits for the CSFA membership.</p>

<p>The CSFEWBC Board of Trustees is assisted in the management by General Manager Bob Hamilton also a past CSFA President. Bob can be reached at:</p>
