<h1>Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment</h1>

<h3>Your PORAC AD&amp;D program...</h3> 
<p>The Insurance and Benefits Trust of PORAC (I &amp; B Trust of PORAC) knows how important financial security is to you and your family and is proud to offer this Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment insurance program. You are urged to carefully consider the program and your own personal needs. Along with the individual and family options offered in this brochure, PORAC would also like to provide a basic level of coverage for every eligible member of PORAC. 
PORAC will pay the premium for your AD&amp;D Core Plan coverage with a Principal Sum of $5,000 on-duty and $1,000 off-duty.</p>
 
<h3>Your PORAC Optional Plan</h3>
<p>As a PORAC member under age 70, you are eligible to enroll in the Optional Plan</p>
 
<h3>You may enroll your eligible dependents too...</h3> 
<p>If you enroll for yourself in the Optional Plan, you may also enroll your eligible dependents. You eligible dependents include your spouse or domestic partner, under age 70, and any unmarried children under 19 years of age (25 years of age, if attending an accredited institution of higher education on a full-time basis and wholly dependent upon you for maintenance and support.) However, a PORAC member may not be covered as both an insured member and as a dependent; also, a dependent child of two members can be enrolled as a dependent of only one insured member.</p>
 
<h3>No Medical Statements are required...</h3> 
<p>You are guaranteed acceptance under this plan. No medical statements or health questionnaires are required.</p>

<p>This program covers you 24 hours a day, on or off the job, worldwide, at home or on vacation, subject to the provisions, exclusions, and limitations of the Policy.</p>
