<h1>Disability Coverages</h1>

<h3><em>Short Term Disability (STD) &amp; Long Term Disability (LTD) Details</em></h3>

<p><em>This is one of the most important insurance coverages a peace officer can have -- Why, because it protects your ability to financially provide for yourself and your family</em></p>

<p>Disability is more common than you think. Did you know...</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Two-thirds of American families live paycheck to paycheck</strong> <cite>(Parade Magazine, Is the American Dream Still Possible?, April 23, 2006).</cite></li>

  <li><strong>Disability causes nearly 50% of all mortgage foreclosures, 2% are caused by death.</strong> <cite>(Health Affairs, The Policy Journal of Health Sphere, February 2, 2005).</cite></li>

  <li><strong>By the nature of peace officer's work, they are more likely to become disabled than most professions.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, you have a one in five chance of becoming disabled. According to the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI), a person age 35 is six times more likely to become disabled than die before he or she reaches age 65. These statistics are based on the general populace. You, as a firefighter have a much higher likelihood of becoming disabled because of both the physical and emotional demands of your career. Simply put, this is your "Paycheck" Insurance coverage on and off the job.</p>

<p>Becoming disabled can have devastating financial implications for you and your family by stripping you of your ability to make a living. While some Members may get by without working for a few months by relying upon their sick leave and savings, few can afford to go without a paycheck for an extended period of time. At some point you will need to ask yourself, "How am I going to take care of my family?" The answer is; the Disability Program through the Insurance and Benefits Trust of PORAC.</p>

<p><strong>Why is the I&amp;B Trust of PORAC plan the best option for PORAC Members?</strong></p>

<p>For over 40 years PORAC Members have had access to Long Term Disability coverage through the Insurance and Benefits Trust/Committee. In February of 2014 the I&amp;B Trust of PORAC introduced their newest disability plan options for Safety Members; the Short Term Disability AND Long Term Disability program. As always, this new program will provide Members with an affordable disability plan without sacrificing the rich benefit schedule or the long term financial security provided through a multi-billion dollar insurance company, Standard Insurance Company. Under this program, the I&amp;B Trust of PORAC self-funds the benefits payable during the first 12 months of a disability. Standard Insurance Company fully insures the benefits after the initial 12 months of disability until age 65. Through this arrangement you receive the cost savings associated with self-funded plans; lower rates, with all the long term benefit guarantees provided by an insurance carrier. Having an insurance company backing the plan long term is vital to providing you and your family with the peace of mind of knowing disability payments will continue to be paid now and in the future.</P>

<p><strong>The I&amp;B Trust of PORAC offers several group disability plan options:</strong></p>
